  <h3>Apron Monitoring System (AMS)</h3>
<p>
The apron can be the most dangerous place at an airport where unusual types of specialized equipment and people with different priorities gather to perform their work, often under significant pressure from time and space constraints. A well-managed apron ensure the safety and efficiency. Flood lighting plays a critical role in ensuring safety and efficiency. Proper illuminance is essential for mitigating risks and facilitating smooth operations on the apron, especially during low-light conditions or adverse weather.</p>
